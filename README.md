# 102103058-Clustering-Analysis
Clustering analysis was conducted on three models: KMeans, Hierarchical, and Birch, with varied preprocessing methods: none, PCA, transformation with normalization, and transformation with normalization and PCA. Evaluation metrics Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin were computed for each model-preprocessing combination to assess clustering performance.
